# sleep-apnea-stimulation
BME349 Instrumentation Design Project.  
Electrical stimulation device designed for treatment of sleep apnea.  

Light absorption data from finger-worn pulse oximeter is relayed to necklace device which delivers transcutaneous electrical stimulation via electrodes to the user's submental throat region to contract collapsing soft airway muscles and prevent apnea episodes. Electrical stimulation is delivered in gradual increments so as to not abruptly wake the user and are calibrated to user's specific settings.
